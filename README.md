# Overview

I created an Expense Tracker program to improve my software engineering skills, specifically in working with SQL databases. This project is a hands-on way for me to understand how databases, SQL queries, and dynamic programming work in a real-world context.

The Expense Tracker helps users keep track of their daily expenses. It works with a SQL database to store and retrieve expense data efficiently. The main focus is to build a simple tool that shows basic operations like adding, updating, and deleting expenses while using a strong database system.

# Relational Database

The software utilizes SQLite as the relational database. The main table, 'expenses,' captures essential information about each expense, including the expense_id (primary key), expense_date, category, and amount. This structure enables efficient organization and retrieval of expense-related data.

# Development Environment

The development environment for this project includes:

- Python
- Visual Studio Code

The programming language used is Python, leveraging the sqlite3 library for database interactions.

# Useful Websites

- [SQLite Documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html): Comprehensive documentation for SQLite, providing guidance on queries, commands, and best practices.
- [W3Schools SQL Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/): A valuable resource for SQL tutorials, covering a wide range of topics from basic to advanced.
- [LinkedIN Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/quick-start-guide-to-sql/introduction-to-rdbms-and-sql?u=2153100): An hour beginners course on SQL using Oracle.

# Future Work

There are several areas for improvement and future additions:

- Implement user authentication for personalized expense tracking.
- Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) to enhance the user experience.
